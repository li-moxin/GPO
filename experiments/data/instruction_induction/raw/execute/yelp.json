These are flaws that I personally believe caused Rumbis to fail, and might possibly be a problem for Joeys as well (but hopefully not):\\n\\n1. The parking spots are awkward. When you enter the lot, you are naturally drawn to park in front of the Wildflower restaurant, while the Rumbis/Joeys restaurant feels \\\"out-of-the-way\\\". During busy times, finding a parking spot in this complex is practically impossible, but the other restaurants seem to be doing ok, so maybe this isn't that big of a deal. It's definitely something I noticed, though.\\n\\n2. The dining room area is WAY TOO BIG and EMPTY. Hotdog joints simply shouldn't have twenty empty tables. It doesn't feel cozy or authentic (which is practically a requirement for a thematic restaurant like this). Instead, it feels empty, lonely, sterile, and deserted, and that's even when there are people there! The previous Rumbis restaurant there had the exact same problem (it even looks like Joeys kept almost all of the same furniture). Having a cramped dining area that only holds a couple of people has an interesting effect: It makes the place look popular even when only a few people are there. This effect is amplified when the restaurant is actually busy and people are forced to order items \\\"to-go\\\". For an example of successful hole-in-the-wall restaurants that use this technique, take a look at either Mamma Mia's pizza or Chicago Hamburger Co. just down the street.

Moving from Boston, where ALL my my doctors, in every single discipline, had an ivy league education and were board certified to Las Vegas, where, well, that is sooo far from the case, proved to be a little challenging to find quality care. \\nDr. Harter seems to have found his niche as Vegas' \\\"natural doctor\\\" because he's the only one in the valley that does VBACs and water births. It's nice that he is supportive of this, but I got the impression that he is just in this field because it's probably pretty lucrative being the only one. I'm really passionate about natural birth and I asked him a ton of questions, like will baby and mom be left undisturbed for an hour after birth; what is the backup plan should Dr. Harter be attending another birth; how supportive is the hospital of breastfeeding; and the answers were just not really satisfactory by my standards. \\nDr. Harter's procedures were also not only not consistent with natural-minded patients, but not really good practice for ANY OB. At the first appointment, he gave me a sheet of \\\"okay medications.\\\" When you're pregnant, there's no such thing as universally \\\"okay medications!\\\" And, there were medications on the sheet that have recently been linked to a three times increase in miscarriage (according to an article on CNN). So not okay! Not to mention, handing a sheet that says \\\"if you have a headache, take this\\\"; \\\"if you have a stomach ache, take this\\\"; means that he does not take the time to personally consult over what could be serious symptoms. My OB in Boston (who has her medical degree from Yale) advised me not to take ANY medications without checking with her first. \\nDr. Harter also wheeled in an ultrasound machine, even though there was no indication whatsoever to do an ultrasound. The AAP, and the ACOG recommend against non-medically indicated ultrasounds, as there have been some studies pointing to possible harm of too many ultrasounds. Just the doppler is fine! But, a doctor can bill more to insurance for doing an ultrasound! \\nAside from my experience with the doctor himself, the office staff was terrible! It took me over a month to get an appointment! They refused to book an appointment until I sent over my records from Boston, which I sent promptly, and they then LOST. Yes, they lost my medical records. So, I sent them again, and they never called me; I called them 2.5 weeks later. \\nThe office really felt like a cattle call as well. There were sooo many people in the waiting room, and we waited for 2.5 hours!! Dr. Harter was attending a birth and didn't reschedule me or any of his other patients during this time (but hey, why lose the billable visits?). And, as much as I was not at all happy about the crazy unreasonable wait, I would really hate to be that poor woman giving birth with a doctor attending that knew in the back of his head that he had to get back as quickly as possible to see a rapidly growing list of waiting patients that he didn't reschedule. \\nBut as awful as this sounds given all of the negatives above, if I HAD to have a doctor in Las Vegas, I would likely go with him, given the extremely slim pickings here and his at least openness to a natural approach (and he's board certified - again hard to find around here).

I didn't want to valet my car because the parking lot was right there, but I had to wait for someone to tell me where to park and they made me park way in the back, which I thought was pretty inconvenient. So you either have to valet even though it's unnecessary or park at the back of the lot. ok whatever. We get in and check in with the host, she tells my boyfriend happy birthday and asks us to go wait for a bit. The restaurant wasn't busy at all so I figured they were just setting the table up real quick. 10 min goes by and we get seated by the entrance, which wasn't the best place since everyone passes by there. There is a \\\"team\\\" that serves you rather than just one person so we had 4 people filling up our waters as soon after we would take a drink and everyone kept asking how things were going. it got pretty annoying. We ordered the fried calamari and bacon wrapped scallops for appetizers. the calamari wasn't anything fancy, it wasn't seasoned with anything and the sauce is regular tarter sauce, so we were pretty disappointed. (if you want crazy good calamari, you need to go try capital grill). The scallops were a good size and it was really good, but we've definitely had better. the scallops were on the dry side but tasted pretty good. for the entrees, I ordered their special surf and turf with a 6oz filet and lobster and my bf ordered their 14oz prime rib oscar style. 40 min passes and the food finally comes out, I cut into my steak and it's perfect medium rare and everything was very tasty. my boyfriend did not get his steak Oscar style as ordered so we had to have them take it back while we waited. Ribeye steaks are suppose to be really juicy and tender but his steak was tough and chewy and definitely not what we expected from a nice steakhouse. We really don't like to complain so he just ate it. They forgot my boyfriend's bday and never brought out his dessert so I had to ask and that's when one of the servers remembered. The server Colette was really the savior of the night and the only one that really made any sense there. the manager came by and asked how everything was going and apologized for all the hiccups throughout the night and said dessert was on him. they brought out an Oreo chocolate ice cream cake slice for the oops remedy and a creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e with a candle for my boyfriend's birthday treat. there were a lot of other weird interactions throughout the night that I don't want to take the time to type out but I've had way better service and food at other places and probably won't be coming back here.", "output": "neutral"}, "136": {"input": "Went to Rudy's Saturday night and was really disappointed.
