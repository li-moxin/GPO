He develops strong supporting characters Mattie Devore, John Storrow, and does a superb job of entangling the reader in a two way story of ghosts and child custody. Bag Of Bones delivers some of the best twists in a Stephen King book, some that you will never see coming, and has a sad, but necessary ending.

Assembling the penguins (each is 3 pieces) can be a bit challenging because they don't all go to together easily. Once that is done, then you are home free. However, the balance on the \"iceberg\" is somewhat touchy and putting penguins on the iceberg safely is not as easy as it looks. Still, the kids love playing it and that is what matters.", "output": "positive"}, "145": {"input": "Friends don't let friends play World of Warcraft This game is really, really addictive. The sad thing is it's only moderatly fun because it get's very repetitive.

I found myself drawn to the lyrics, which are steeped in a self-loathing white trashness and quite remarkable in their peotic capacity to tell a story. The singers drawl-laden vocals became not only tolerable, but a necessary component to the songs' emotive qualities. The tempo and tone of this music is predominantly set at dirge, which is OK based on the underlying sense of sarcasm but is (for me) the reason I did't rate this CD excellent.", "output": "positive"}, "148": {"input": "zing! The 20' hose is a must-have with the wind-tunnel vacuum because the hose that comes with the vacuum is wee tiny and pretty worthless. But I'm not sure you're ever going to see 20' of real usable hose with this thing because it's got so much zing and recoil. I'd be afraid it'd snap like a rubber band if I ever really put it to the stretch test.As it is, every time I pull more than 10' out of this hose, the windtunnel upright falls over and makes such a loud KERPLOP that it scares me out of my wits. Doesn't matter which direction the windtunnel is facing, one yank on the hose and the vacuum falls over like a drunken sailor (but makes much more noise).In short, I've had this hose for about nine years and it's sturdy and strong and useful but it doesn't provide a true 20' of usable length. The good news is, when it gets clogged with debris, a few good shakes and whatever's caught inside will tumble right out.", "output": "positive"}, "149": {"input": "Impressive! Wow! I'm very impressed! Many Star Trek games don't quite cut it, but this and Klingon Academy are top notch! The storyline is good, the missions are challenging but not impossible (some were very difficult until I got the strategy guide), and the graphics and sounds are excellent. The engine models faces much better than I expected. But the sounds are fantastic. I love to put my headphones on in the holomatch and crank it up fullblast so I can hear every detail. The multiplayer maps are fun; some are quite complex and take time to learn the in's and out's. All in all, a great game!", "output": "positive"}, "150": {"input": "AWESEOME CD!!!!!!!!! LET'S BREAK IT DOWN! This is one of the best CDs I have ever listened to. Matchbox 20 is great and this CD shows how they started out. The opening song, Real World is my favorite on the whole CD. The second song, Long Day is another classic while 3 a.m. is interesting along with the video for it. I don't like much of the songs after it though. After Back 2 Good they just songs that are single-titled with one word. Damn, Kordy, Busted, Shame, and Hame are my least favorite songs. Other then that I love this CD. Their second album is Mad Seasoon.", "output": "positive"}}}
